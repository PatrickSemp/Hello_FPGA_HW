Only, you need:

1. Created the System Builder
2. In the Devices Features Section you check MDDR option and click next
3. In the Memories Section, click in MDDR tab, click on import configuration, and selected the file that i am attaching
4. It is all specific configuration that it needed, and the other settings you can leave as default.
