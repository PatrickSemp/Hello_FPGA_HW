### ðŸ˜ƒ Hi, If you need to use external DDR of Hello FPGA Kit, I am attaching the file that you could be needed.

Only, you need:

1. Created the System Builder
2. In the Devices Features Section you check MDDR option and click next
3. In the Memories Section, click in MDDR tab, click on import configuration, and selected the file that i am attaching
4. It is all specific configuration that it needed, and the other settings you can leave as default.
### ðŸ“‘ So, I attached the datasheet of MT41K1G8 if you want more details...
