   Hello FPGA Kit Example Projects
  </h1>
  
Welcome to this repository! Here you will find example projects designed for the [Hello FPGA Kit](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/m2s-hello-fpga-kit) . As there are little information and examples available on the internet for this kit now, my goal is to provide a useful guide for those who wish to learn more about it and accelerate their development.

## :ledger: Why use this repository?
- ###  Accelerated learning
If you are new to the world of FPGAs or the Hello FPGA board, these projects will serve as a starting point to better understand its features.

- ### Save time 
You can use these examples as a source for your own projects, thus avoiding starting from scratch.

- ### Community
Contribute to the growth of the FPGA community by sharing your ideas, improvements, or new applications based on this kit.

## :star2: Contents
Each project includes:

- Description of function.
- Setup and execution instructions.
- Commented code for easy understanding.


## :arrow_forward: Get started

#### 1.You need to install Libero Software
If you don't have Libero Software installed, you can check out these videos on Youtube in [English](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGqLeYmdNJk) or [Spanish](https://youtu.be/EY03gG8uqQw?si=l7iTwqHwFdsWK8VH) language to install it. 

- **Only Windows Version**

#### 2. Install Hello FPGA GUI and Terminal Emulator Program
- The Hello FPGA GUI is software for programming the board without [FLASHPRO Programmer](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/FLASHPRO5). You can find it on [Microchip Page](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/aemDocuments/documents/FPGA/SOCDesignFiles/Hello_FPGA_GUI_Application.zip) in Documentation section called **Hello FPGA GUI Application**. 

- Terminal emulator program will be used when we need to print information although UART. As the UART functions in Hello FPGA GUI doesn't work as well now, we need to download these kind of programs. All projects that have UART functions have been tested with **TeraTerm** , the latest version of which can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/TeraTermProject/teraterm/releases/download/v5.3/teraterm-5.3.exe) if you wish.

## :robot: Examples

See some examples of data transmission, using Microcontroller Subsystem and FPGA fabric. You will find VHDL and C code, and links to try out or edit the examples and test in your kit.

For more examples check out the [Examples](https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl/tree/master/examples) folder.
