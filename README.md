# Hello FPGA Board Example Projects
Welcome to this repository! Here you will find example projects designed for the [Hello FPGA Kit](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/m2s-hello-fpga-kit) . As there are little information and examples available on the internet for this kit now, my goal is to provide a useful guide for those who wish to learn more about it and accelerate their development.
