   Hello FPGA Kit Example Projects
  </h1>
  
Welcome to this repository! Here you will find example projects designed for the [Hello FPGA Kit](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/m2s-hello-fpga-kit) . As there are little information and examples available on the internet for this kit now, my goal is to provide a useful guide for those who wish to learn more about it and accelerate their development.

## :ledger: Why use this repository?
### Accelerated learning
If you are new to the world of FPGAs or the Hello FPGA board, these projects will serve as a starting point to better understand its features.

### Save time 
You can use these examples as a source for your own projects, thus avoiding starting from scratch.

### Community
Contribute to the growth of the FPGA community by sharing your ideas, improvements, or new applications based on this kit.

## :blue_book: Contents
Each project includes:

- Description of function.
- Setup and execution instructions.
- Commented code for easy understanding.

## :heart: Contributions

- *If you would like to contribute new examples, improvements, or fixes, you are more than welcome! Open an issue or submit a pull request so others can benefit from your contributions as well.*

## How to get started?

#### 1.You need to install Libero Software
If you don't have Libero Software installed, you can check out these videos on Youtube in [English](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGqLeYmdNJk) or [Spanish](https://youtu.be/EY03gG8uqQw?si=l7iTwqHwFdsWK8VH) language to install it. 

#### 2. Install Hello FPGA GUI and TeraTerm
The Hello FPGA GUI is software for programming the board without JTAG. you can find it on [Microchip Page](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/aemDocuments/documents/FPGA/SOCDesignFiles/Hello_FPGA_GUI_Application.zip) in Documentation section called **Hello FPGA GUI Application**. 
TeraTerm is a terminal emulator program that will be used when need to print information although UART, and you can download on this [link](https://github.com/TeraTermProject/teraterm/releases/download/v5.3/teraterm-5.3.exe)
